The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security of our users.

_How to report a security vulnerability?_

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our contracts send it to us by submitting issues right here.

Please include the following details with your report:
- A description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability.
- A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.

_Guidelines_

We ask that all reporters:
- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing.
- Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information directly to us.
- Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and us until we’ve had at least 30 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us directly, we commit to work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
